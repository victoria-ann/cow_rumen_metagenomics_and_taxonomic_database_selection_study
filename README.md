# Impact of Taxonomic Database Choice on Fungal Community Analysis in Cow Rumen Using ITS Data 
This repository contains all materials for a bioinformatics analysis of cow rumen fungal communities using ITS sequencing data. The study evaluates the effects of taxonomic database choice, diet (high-fiber vs. high-grain), active dry yeast supplementation, and sample location (rumen fluid vs. epimural) on diversity metrics and community composition. It includes: <br>
<br>
R scripts (.R) – Code for processing ITS sequences with DADA2, performing taxonomic assignment with UNITE and RDP LSU databases, calculating alpha and beta diversity, relative abundance, and source tracking.<br>
<br>
Manuscript – Full paper detailing study design, methods, results, and conclusions on the impact of database choice on fungal community interpretation. <br>
<br>
This repository enables reproducibility of the analysis performed in this study.
